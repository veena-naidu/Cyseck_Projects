# Cyseck_Projects
CYSECK is a cybersecurity hands-on program focused on practical learning through real-time experimentation and project-based exposure. This repository documents the applied understanding of cybersecurity concepts gained during the program, emphasizing learning by doing rather than theory alone.

The program aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world cybersecurity practices while building a strong, continuously growing project portfolio. All activities are performed in ethical and controlled environments.
